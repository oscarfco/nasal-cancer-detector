# Deep Learning Cancer Detector

Worked with unique data provided by Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania to develop a novel CNN architecture to detect malignant nasal tumors.

This project was written in collaboration with two of my classmates, Andrew & Dina, for Stanford's CS231n: "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition".
